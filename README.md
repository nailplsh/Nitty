# Nitty - simple discord.js utility bot

> Made for Hazel the Nitwit and his collaborators, built to act as an example bot

## How do I use it?

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2.  Run one of the following commands to start the bot:

Before running, you have to install the global dependency `ts-node`
```bash
npm install -g ts-node
// Once you installed it, you can run the bot with
npm run dev
// or
npm run prod
```

The difference between the two is that `npm run dev` will restart the bot when you make changes to the code, while `npm run prod` will not.
